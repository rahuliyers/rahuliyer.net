# Virtual Private Clouds

## IPv4 Address

An IPv4 address looks like this: 192.168.0.1

The address is 32 bits in length, with each number separated by a period being an eight bit number.

Hence an IPv4 address can be expressed as a decimal or a binary number:


| Format  | Representation |
| --- | ----------- |
| Decimal: | 192.168.0.1|
| Binary: | 1100000000 . 10101000 . 00000000 . 00000001 |

IPv4 limit = 2<sup>32</sup> bits = 4294967296 addresses, excluding reserved blocks.

### Classful Networking :

| Network Class | Addresses |
| --- | --- |
| A |  2<sup>24</sup> |
| B |  2<sup>16</sup> |
| C |  2<sup>8</sup>  |

But IPv4 has only 4 Billion addresses (ran out of them.) So we have IPv6 now, which has 128Bits!
